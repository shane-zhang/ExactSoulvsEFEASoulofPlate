The major difficulty of this script is the calculation of series summation after the complex differential. Due to the existence of symbolic variables in double series, when the order of the double series increases, for example 50 and 50, the length of the calculation result after the complex differential will be incredibly long. So, when the calculation process reaches series summation after the complex differential, the summation itself will multiple the length of the calculation result which the Matlab can not properly handled. For instance, when the order of the double series is 50-50, N equals 208 (N denotes the order of series summation after the complex differential). For every x and y, one single series summation after the complex differential, from 1 to N, will need approximately 30 hours calculation time, which is unaffordable.
So the key demand for revision the calculation of series summation after the complex differential in order to shorten the calculation time is urged.
